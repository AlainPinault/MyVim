# MyVim - templates
### These functions do not work properly with any plugin I tried
### use them with real vim (ie gvim in windows systems)
### use a bash vim and vim the file 
### On the second line type the following command or series of character if you prefer (lol)
# "ayy@a 
### and then this command or series of character
# 3@a
### Magic has happened
### to undo just type u
### every time you press @a


### I just hope this is not too confusing
